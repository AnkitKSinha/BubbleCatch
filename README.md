# BubbleCatch
BubbleCatch is an interactive game developed in C++. It is GUI supported. Herein the player needs to catch bubbles coming from one end of the screen, by hovering mouse over them. The game gets interesting as the player progresses, because the speed at which bubbles come increases with time. If 3 bubbles are not caught or a dark bubble is caught, the game gets over.
